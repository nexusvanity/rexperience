# Windows reXPerience
A website for my own 10toXP mod-- reXPerience.
To be precise, **reXPerience** is a mod that's supposed to transform your PC looking from 10 to be exactly like XP the best I can.
While I'm not an insane, or an adept modder. I _am_ still a modder. so I'll try making one--

> [!NOTE]
This mod is still in WIP. There is no presumed release date for when will it come out (as I'm currently balancing between 14 projects)
> [!WARNING]
> If you're doing game development-- this mod may break some game-dev related things for some reason. Unconfirmed why.

Currently, this mod is unreleased-- and I'm just publishing this site as I DO want to work in something.
